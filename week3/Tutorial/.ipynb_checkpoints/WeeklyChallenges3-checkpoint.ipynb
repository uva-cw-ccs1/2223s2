The json file is structures as follows: it is a dictionary in which keys are titles of the books you read and values the ratings you gave them on a scale from 1-10. You want to know which books were rates as excellent, which as good and which were not so good. You have written a function to do so, but it seems not to work. Use debugging techniques discussed in class to solve the errors."
